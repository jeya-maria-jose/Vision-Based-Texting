# Vision-Based-Texting_usingNN
An Neural Network based approach towards eye gesture classification and using it for Texting.
video.py - To check if camera is working
eyeclas.py - To train the network with dataset
nn.py -  To check the gesture of an already stored input image using trained network
clasi.py - To check the current gesture from real time image feed from camera
